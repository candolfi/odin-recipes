    <h3> Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> 400g dried pasta (I prefer spaghettini for this recipes) </li>
                <li> 3-4 cloves of garlic (minced)</li>
                <li> 1/4 cup of butter</li>
                <li> Approximately 20 small shrimp (deveined and shell removed)</li>
                <li> Arugula (a few handfuls will do)</li>
                <li> Salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
                <li> Oregano (to taste)</li>
                <li> Red chili flakes (to taste)</li>
                <li> Freshly grated parmesan</li>
            </ul>

    <h3> Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li> Start off by adding a small amount of butter to pan on medium heat <p>
                    <em> we can start boiling a large pot of water for the pasta while completing the following steps</em>
                </p></li>
                <li> When the butter is completely melted, add the minced garlic, oregano and red chilli flakes to the pan</li>
                <li> Once the garlic starts to become aromatic, add the shrimp, salt and pepper and cook until the shrimp is pink throughout</li>
                <li> Remove the shrimp from the pan once it is fully cooked and add the rest of the butter</li>
                <li> Once the butter is completely melted we can add the arugla. Stir until it begins to wilt</li>
                <li> When the water reaches a rolling boil, add a generous amount of salt followed by the dried pasta 
                     cook the pasta until just before the time specified on the package is reached</li>
                <li> Finish cooking the pasta by adding it to the pan of arugla along with a half cup of the pasta water. Make sure to stir regularly</li>
                <li> Once the pasta is cooked, plate along with the shrimp we set aside earlier</li>
                <li> Finish off with freshly grated parmesan and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
