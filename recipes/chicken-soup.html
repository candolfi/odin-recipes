    <h2> A hearty soup for those winter days</h2>

        <p> This soup is extremely versatile and easy to cook! The vegetables and spices can easily be substituted for others but I am sharing my favourite version with you today</p>
        <p> For cold weather or simply days where you need a pick me up, this is the perfect recipe</p>

    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
        <em> Serves 3-4</em>
            <ul>
                <li> 1 medium yellow onion (diced)</li>
                <li> 2 medium sized carrots (chopped coarsely)</li>
                <li> 2 ribs of celery (chopped coarsely)</li>
                <li> 1 lb of skinless chicken (I use legs but you can use whatever you like!)</li>
                <li> 1/4 cup of red lentils</li>
                <li> salt, pepper, oregano and red chili flakes to taste</li>
                <li> A dash of olive oil</li>
            </ul>

    <h3> Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> First off, start my turning the kettle on. You'll need enough water to cover your soup ingredients</li>
            <li> Add olive oil to a large pot on medium heat</li>
            <li> Once the oil begins to shimmer, add all of your vegetables and fry until the onions and celery become translucent</li>
            <li> Next add the boiling water, followed by the chicken. Afterwards, top up with additional water to cover the ingredients as necessarry</li>
            <li> Add your seasoning (as much or as little as you like)</li>
            <li> Get the soup up to a boil and then cover and simmer for 90 - 120 minutes with a lid on</li>
            <li> This part is optional but at this point, I like to remove the chicken and take the meat off the bones before re-adding it to the soup</li>
            <li> Lastly, add your red lentils and cook for a final 10 minutes before serving!</li>
        </ol>
