            <ul>
                <li> 1-2 kg side of ribs (the packages vary greatly in weight so as much as you like really)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
                <li>2 tsp salt</li>
                <li>2 tsp ground black pepper</li>
                <li>2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
                <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>Enough of your favourite barbecue sauce to cover the ribs</li>
            </ul>

    <h3> Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start off by pre-heating the oven to 250 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
            <li>Prepare the ribs by removing the membrane if not done by the butcher already</li>
            <li>Mix all the seasonings together to create a dry spice rub</li>
            <li>Generously season the ribs on all sides with the spice rib</li>
            <li>Place the ribs in a deep dish. If they don't fit, it's ok to cut them up into smaller portions</li>
            <li>Cover the dish with tin foil <strong>(It is very important to seal the dish well. Otherwise the ribs will dry out!)</strong></li>
            <li>Cook the ribs for atleast 2 hours, preferably 3</li>
            <em>At this point you have the option of finishing the ribs with the oven broiler or a barbecue</em>
            <li>Remove the ribs and brush on your barbecue sauce before placing them uncovered in the broiler or on the barbecue at high heat for 3-4 minutes</li>
            <li>At this point they are ready to be enjoyed!</li>
        </ol>
